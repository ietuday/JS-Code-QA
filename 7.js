/**
new Number() is a built-in function constructor. Although it looks like a 
number, it's not really a number: it has a bunch of extra features and is
an object.When we use the == operator, it only checks whether it has the 
same value. They both have the value of 3, so it returns true.However, 
when we use the === operator, both value and type should be the same. 
It's not: new Number() is not a number, it's an object. Both return false.
